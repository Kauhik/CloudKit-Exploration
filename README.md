# CloudKit Framework Overview

CloudKit is built into **iOS**, **macOS**, **iPadOS**, **watchOS**, and **tvOS**, providing a seamless way for your app to store structured data in iCloud containers. It offers three database types:

- **Private Database**: Unique per user.
- **Public Database**: Shared by all users.
- **Shared Database**: Collaborative record zones.

With CloudKit, you work with **records** and **fields** (similar to rows and columns in a database), and Apple's servers automatically handle **network communication**, **data encryption**, and **device syncing**.

## What is CloudKit?

CloudKit powers iCloud integration for developers, giving your app direct access to Apple’s cloud servers **without needing a custom backend**. 

### Key Features:

- Import the `CloudKit` module to **fetch**, **save**, **update**, or **delete** records.
- Define record types and schemas using **CloudKit Dashboard**.
- Query records with **NSPredicate**–based queries.
- System handles syncing, conflict resolution, and data security.

## About This App

This simple **To-Do demo** shows CloudKit in action for complete beginners:

- **Create tasks**: Type in the text field and tap the ➕ button.
- **Read tasks**: View a list that automatically syncs with your private iCloud database.
- **Update tasks**: Tap the circle to mark as complete, or swipe right to edit.
- **Delete tasks**: Swipe left on a task.

### Under the Hood:

- Each task maps to a **ToDoItem** record type (`title`, `isComplete` fields) in your CloudKit container.
- A `CloudKitManager` class handles all **CRUD** operations against the private database.
- Changes sync instantly across all devices signed into the same iCloud account.
- You can inspect data live using the [CloudKit Dashboard](https://developer.apple.com/icloud/cloudkit/).
